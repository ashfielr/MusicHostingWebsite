## Features Implemented ##
### Stage 1 - Part 1 Functionality ###
The home screen is only viewable once a user has logged in and displays a list of the tracks uploaded by that user with the following data being shown:
* The name of the track.
* The artist name.
* The album art.
* The duration (in minutes and seconds).

### Stage 1 - Part 2 Functionality ###
A link or button on the home screen takes the user to an upload screen where they can upload more tracks.
This screen:
* Displays a list of all the tracks with title, artist, album art and duration.
* Allows the user to upload an .mp3 file from their computer.

> Note: the user must not be asked to input the track, artist name or duration, nor upload album art, this information must be extracted directly from the uploaded file.

### Stage 1 - Part 3 Functionality ###
If the user selects a track on the home screen by clicking on either the track name or artist text are taken to a page which displays all the ID3 data extracted from the file.

The page allows the track to be played, paused and also includes a scrub bar to track how much of the track has been played.
